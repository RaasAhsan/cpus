# z80

This project provides a full-featured environment for Z80 CPUs:
- An assembler
- A disassembler
- An emulator

Kotlin is the choice of language for this codebase for several reasons:
1. Principled and disciplined language
2. Targets JVM
3. Targets LLVM -- we can also target WASM and use the codebase for browser applications
